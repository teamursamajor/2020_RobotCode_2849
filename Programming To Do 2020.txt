### PROGRAMMING TO DO 2020 ###

META:
* Give members opportunities to code/learn/work independently
* Make sure people understand Java, how to debug stuff, working with WPILib

SPINNER:
* Make PID control for spinner detecting colors
* Figure out color offset situation (measurable impact?)
* Comment/reorganize class

AUTOCOMPILER:
* Add math operation/paretheses/comma support
* Use Logger to log errors in parsing when throwing exceptions
* Test AutoCompiler with generating basic tasks
* Use AutoCompiler/Pathmaker to design auto modes
  - Get Chris to come back for Pathmaker ;-;
  - Maybe use Pathfinder/Pathweaver instead
* Make script syntax and class documentation when all's said and done

DRIVETRAIN:
* Test automatic turn tasks
* Figure out why the drivetrain swerves (left/right power difference?)

CLIMBER:
* Use encoders to move the required distance
* Work out design details with motors
* PID control?

INTAKE/OUTTAKE:
* Use limit switches/line break sensors to count the number of cells
* Synchronize intake/outtake so that outtaking resets number of cells
* Work out design details with motors
* PID control?

EXTRA:
* Document code so we know what stuff does
* Incorporate Logger for debug/error info
* Figure out if we need Limelight, and if so, how to use it
* Figure out if we should use Pixy instead, and if so, how to use it
* Get LEDs working so we look cool
