### PROGRAMMING TO DO 2020 ###

META:
* Give members opportunities to code/learn/work independently
* Make sure people understand Java, how to debug stuff, working with WPILib
* Document code so we know what stuff does
* Incorporate Logger for debug/error info
* Move subsystem mode enums to subsystem classes? Or keep in modes?

SPINNER:
* Comment/reorganize class

AUTOCOMPILER:
* Add math operation/paretheses/comma support
* Use Logger to log errors in parsing when throwing exceptions
* Test AutoCompiler with generating basic tasks
* Use AutoCompiler to design auto modes
  - Maybe use Pathfinder/Pathweaver instead
* Make script syntax and class documentation when all's said and done

DRIVETRAIN:
* Look into how Falcons work and modify Drive code in accordance
* Figure out how to do motion profiling
* Test automatic turning, driving, etc. with limited acceleration

CLIMBER:
* Test and refine system

INTAKE/OUTTAKE:
* Test and refine system

EXTRA:
* Figure out if we should use Pixy instead, and if so, how to use it
* Get LEDs working so we look cool
