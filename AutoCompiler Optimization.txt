OPTIMIZATIONS:
- Just say "outtake" and have it generate outtake out, wait, outtake in tasks
- Just say "intake" and have it generate whatever other tasks
- Make "intake" control the belt smartly too. Belt task is kind of superfluous
  > FOR NOW: just use execute and "routine" modes since we're low on time
- AutoSelector -- maybe just make a couple presets but you don't need a super intense selector
- relative turning
- general commands (abstraction!)
- ultrasonic sensors for distance?
